// This file can be used for shared TypeScript types across the application.
// For example:
// export interface UserProfile {
//   id: string;
//   name: string;
//   email: string;
// }

// Currently empty as specific shared types are not immediately required by the prompt.
// Forms have their types defined locally within their respective component files.
